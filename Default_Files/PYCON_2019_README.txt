Welcome to CircuitPython!
#############################

Hello PyCon - we wanted to have a fun ~electronic~ item, that
does more than just a sticker! What you have in your hand is a special 
edition Circuit Playground Express, brought to you by Adafruit and Digi-Key.

This hardware comes pre-loaded with CircuitPython! CircuitPython is Adafruit's
branch of MicroPython designed to simplify experimentation and education on 
low-cost microcontrollers. It makes it easier than ever to get prototyping 
by requiring no upfront desktop software downloads.

With CircuitPython you can write clean and simple Python 3 code to control 
hardware instead of having to use complex low-level languages like C or C++ 
(what Arduino uses for programming). It's great for beginners and is powerful
for experts.

Enjoy PyCon 2019!

Thanks!
  - the Adafruit and Digi-Key teams

The Circuit Playground Express has limited disk space so we have disabled Mac OS X indexing
which could take up that valuable space. 

So *please* do not remove the empty .fseventsd/no_log, .metadata_never_index 
or .Trashes files!

The pre-loaded demo shows off some of what your Circuit Playground Express 
can do with CircuitPython:
  * The NeoPixel ring on the CPX will do one of three LED animations based on your board's
  unique ID. It will flash Digi-Key colors, Python colors or a red-comet rainbow swirl.
  * The switch controls the little red LED. Move the switch left and right to turn the red
  LED on and off.
  * Press the buttons to play sounds. Button A and button B each play a different wav files.
  * Change the TONE_PIANO variable to True at the top of the file to enable a tone piano on
  the touch pads. Once enabled, you can touch the pads labeled A1-A7 to play a scale of tones.

Getting Start with Circuit Playground Express book excerpt!

Also included is a special preview edition of "Getting Started with Adafruit Circuit
Playground Express: The Multipurpose Learning and Development Board with Built-In LEDs,
Sensors, and Accelerometer" by Mike Barela. Make: Magazine gave PyCon, Adafruit &
Digi-Key special permission to include the CircuitPython chapter of the book for all
attendees to learn from and enjoy! Because CircuitPython allows devices to be USB
drives, the PDF is included right on the Circuit Playground Express! The complete book
is available on Adafruit and where programming books are sold:

CircuitPython Quick Start:

Changing the code is as easy as editing code.py in your favorite text editor. 

Our recommended editor is Mu, which is great for simple projects, and comes
with a built in REPL serial viewer! It is available for Mac, Windows & Linux
https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/installing-mu-editor

After the file is saved, CircuitPython will automatically reload the latest 
code.

Connecting to the serial port will give you access to sensor information, 
better error messages and an interactive CircuitPython (known as the REPL). 
On Windows we recommend Mu, Tera Term or PuTTY. 
On Mac OSX and Linux, use Mu or 'screen' can be used from a terminal.
